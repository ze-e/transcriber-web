00:00:00 -  The internet is currently going crazy over the Catholic Church's new mascot for the 2025 Vatican Jubilee year.
00:00:06 -  The Jubilee year happens every 25 years in the Catholic Church, and it is a special time to focus on the spiritual life, especially forgiveness and reconciliation.
00:00:14 -  The last one we celebrated was in the year 2000.
00:00:17 -  This upcoming year, the Jubilee year begins on December 8th, 2024, and ends on November 24th, 2025.
00:00:24 -  For this year's Jubilee, the Vatican has decided to release a new mascot to reach out to the youth.
00:00:29 -  This character actually has a lot of spiritual resemblance in its design.
00:00:33 -  The name Luce or Luce means the word light in Italian.
00:00:37 -  The light in the shape of a shell in her eyes represents a perseverance in faith.
00:00:41 -  We even see her wearing a mission rosary.
00:00:43 -  This is a rosary that was designed by Venerable Fulton Sheen.
00:00:47 -  This mascot will even be showcased at the Italian equivalent of Comic Con, Luca Comics and Games, an event for TV show, video game, and comic fans.
00:00:56 -  There's a whole spectrum of what people think about this character.
00:00:59 -  Some people think it's brilliant, and that it's a good way to shed the light of Catholicism onto anime culture.
00:01:05 -  On the contrary, there are some who say this is a terrible idea, and that the Church shouldn't be promoting anime because of its notorious culture.
00:01:13 -  What do you think about the new mascot? Do you think it'll benefit the Catholic Church?
00:01:17 -  Personally, I think this character could help evangelize Japan, as well as many anime and Nintendo fans who like the art style.
00:01:24 -  Though it's definitely not something you'd expect to be released by the Vatican, or something that resembles the beauty of the faith,
00:01:30 -  it may possibly help lead some to the Catholic Church, and discover the charm and alluring history of the faith for themselves.
